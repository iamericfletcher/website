        <h2 style="text-align: center">Is Anki the best tool for helping form new memories?<br>I say YES, and here's
            why.</h2>

        <br>

        I'm always on the lookout for ways to increase my ability to retain information. It could be a remarkable
        fact I've stumbled across in an article, or a particular theory that I need to learn for an exam, or heck,
        even my company's mission or vision statement. Whatever it may be, if it strikes me (or you) as interesting
        or worthwhile, chances are it also may be worth committing to memory.

        <br><br>

        This outlook sounds good on paper, but finding strategies or techniques for remembering that are conducive
        to my (or your) particular learning style can be incredibly challenging. For me, this has been a lifelong
        journey that's seen more in the way of failure than success. So when I happen to stumble across something
        that helps me remember things, it's pretty exciting! That something is Anki.

        <br><br>

        <h2 style="text-align: center">What is Anki</h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Anki&nbsp;</strong></a>is
            an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source" target="_blank"
                       rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>open-source</strong></a>&nbsp;program
            whose leading developer is the incredibly talented&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dae" target="_blank"
                                                                       rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Damien
            Elmes</strong></a>.
            At its core, Anki is a free flashcard program that utilizes a technique used in cognitive science called
            spaced repetition, where the desired information is&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html"
                                                                        target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>spread
            out over time instead of studying multiple times in one session</strong></a>.&nbsp;

        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            For me, the spaced repetition at the core of Anki's algorithm sets this program apart from other methods of
            memorization I have used over the years, like cramming, reading things repeatedly, writing things out on
            paper, mnemonics, and mind mapping.&nbsp;</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Don't just take my word for it!&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126970/"
                                                    target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Science has also
            shown that this approach to learning is preferable to other methods that don't utilize consistent repetition
            over time</strong></a>.
        </p>

        <br><br>


        <h2 style="text-align: center">Who Should use Anki?</h2>

        <br>

        <p>There are so many potential use cases for this program. A brief list I came up with includes:</p>

        <br>

        - Preparing for the next board meeting
        <br>
        - Memorizing your companies mission, vision, or sales pitch.
        <br>
        - Preparing for a presentation.
        <br>
        - Preparing for an upcoming interview.
        <br>
        - Preparing for an exam.
        <br>
        - Preparing for professional certifications.
        <br>
        - Learning a new language.
        <br>
        - Those recovering from a traumatic brain injury working on memory development.
        <br>
        - Putting names to faces.
        <br>
        - Chess players wanting to memorize opening moves or strategies.


        <br><br>


        <h2 style="text-align: center">How Does it Work?</h2>

        <br>

        <p>Anki users assign ratings after each flashcard is reviewed. The rating is based on the flashcards difficulty
            level and determines the time until Anki displays the card again. Anki's implementation of spaced repetition
            in software was pioneered by another flashcard program called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en"
                                                                                  target="_blank"
                                                                                  rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>SuperMemo</strong></a>.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Anki comes with&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html#cards" target="_blank"
                                   rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>four types of flashcards</strong></a>&nbsp;described
            below:</p>
        <br>
        <b>Basic</b> <br>
        Has Front and Back fields, and will create one card. The text you enter in Front will appear
        on the front of the card, and text you enter in Back will appear on the back of the card.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Basic (and reversed card)</b> <br>
        Like Basic, but creates two cards for the text you enter: one from
        front→back and one from back→front.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Basic (optional reversed card)</b> <br>
        This is a front→back card, and optionally a back→front card. To do
        this, it has a third field called "Add Reverse." If you enter any text into that field, a reverse card
        will be created.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Cloze</b> <br>
        A note type which makes it easy to select text and turn it into a cloze deletion (e.g., "Man
        landed on the moon in [… ]" → "Man landed on the moon in 1969").


        <br>

        <p>So far, cloze has been my favorite card type since the additional text helps clue me into the correct answer.
            However, if I really need to commit something to memory, I will opt instead for the basic card type since
            less text could potentially help spur my memory.</p>


        <br><br>


        <h2 style="text-align: center">Add-ons and Additional Features</h2>

        <br>


        <p>Anki is open-source and encourages third-party developers to create&nbsp;<a
                href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>valuable
            add-ons</strong></a>. One of my favorite add-ons is the&nbsp;<a
                href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1374772155" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Image
            Occlusion Enhanced for Anki 2.1</strong></a>. This add-on allows Anki users to turn images into flashcards
            by hiding and revealing selected sections of the picture. The graphical user interface for this add-on is
            easy to use and full of valuable features.&nbsp;</p>


        <p>Below are some additional features pulled from&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank"
                                                                  rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Anki's
            website</strong></a>.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Synchronization*&nbsp;Use the free AnkiWeb synchronization service to keep your cards in sync across multiple
            devices.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Flexibility&nbsp;From card layout to review timing, Anki has a wealth of options for you to customize.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Media-Rich&nbsp;Embed audio clips, images, videos, and scientific markup on your cards, with precise control
            over how it's shown.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Optimized&nbsp;Anki will handle decks of 100,000+ cards with no problems.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Fully Extensible&nbsp;There are a large number of add-ons available.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Open Source&nbsp;Because the code and storage format is open, your important data is safe.</p>

        <br>

        <p>*The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ankiapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Anki mobile
            application</strong></a>&nbsp;cost me $25. In my opinion, the cost is well worth it. The application is rich
            with helpful features that are well maintained. Heck, there isn't much you can't do with the mobile
            application that you can do with the desktop version.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Another beneficial feature is Anki's ability to share and&nbsp;<a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/"
                                                                             target="_blank"
                                                                             rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>download
            community decks</strong></a>. Community decks are an excellent option for Anki users interested in learning
            a particular subject but may not have the time to create their own deck.&nbsp;</p>

        <br>

        <p>Popular community deck categories include:</p>

        <br>

        <ul>
            <li>Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish</li>
            <li>Anatomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geography, History, Law, Math, Music, Pathology, Physics</li>
        </ul>
